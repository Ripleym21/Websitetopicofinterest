    Esports is a form of competition using video games.<br> Most commonly, 
    esports takes the form of organized,<br> multiplayer video game 
    competitions, particularly<br> between professional players. 
    Although organized <br>online and offline competitions have 
    long been a part <br>of video game culture, these were largely 
    between <br>amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation 
    by<br> professional gamers and spectatorship in these events 
    <br>through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.
    <br>By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the 
    <br>video game industry, with many game developers <br>actively
    designing toward a professional esports subculture.
